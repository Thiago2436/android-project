            <h1>History of the Android logo</h1>

            <p>The software's logo makes it clear that the user is looking at a friendly and technically advanced assistant robot. The living symbol of the Android logo is watching the process and is ready to help at any moment.</p>

                Android: Brand overview <br>
                Founded:	September 23, 2008 <br>
                Founder:	Various (mostly Google) <br>
                Headquarters:  United States <br>

            </h4>

            <p>The Android brand strives to be as inclusive as possible because it introduces an open operating system that reaches billions of active users. The OS is designed for various devices, including smartphones, TVs, watches, cars, tablets, and other equipment. The platform's first version appeared in 2008 – three years after the multinational company <strong>Google</strong> acquired <strong>Android, Inc.</strong></p>

            <h2>Meaning and History</h2>


            <p>The release of the mobile operating system was announced in 2007. At the same time, the leaders of the Google corporation started thinking about the visual identity of their new product and brought in a whole team of designers. <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" rel="external" class="link-external">Irina Blok</a> received the order for the development of the logo. Together with her colleagues, she created sketches of all kinds of androids because the delusional owners wanted a robot to be the star of the image. Before the chosen option became a well-known Android icon, it went through many changes and transformations. We all know and mostly love the Green Android 'Bugdroid' that is Google's official mascot for their mobile OS but according to <strong>Dan Morrill</strong> who used to be the Developer Relations Manager for Android that wasn't the first mascot for the OS. To find out more about the first concepts the Android mascot <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" rel="external" class="link-external">click here</a>.</p>

            <h2>2008 – 2019</h2>
            <img src="Android-Logo-2008-2019-700x394.png" alt="Android Logo 2008-2019">

            <p>The first version of the robot was black and white, but that did not stop it from becoming an international symbol. Graphic designer Irina Blok used simple geometric shapes as building blocks. The torso is an asymmetric square, the head is a semicircle, the antennae are small thin lines, the eyes are white circles, and the limbs are wide stripes with rounded ends. From a banal set of elements, a memorable logo has turned out, with which all Internet users are now familiar.</p>


            <p>Irina Blok experimented for a long time before she came to the final version. She looked for inspiration from a variety of sources, including science-fiction films. But the pursuit of the stars was not inspiring enough. In the end, Irina Blok took the tablets from the toilet doors, where figures of men and women are drawn, made up of circles, triangles and squares. This option turned out to be the most successful because it is understandable to people worldwide. There were also rumors that the android was copied from a character from the arcade game Gauntlet: The Third Encounter, but the designer denied the plagiarism charges.</p>

            <h2>2008 – 2014</h2>

            <p>After a little tweaking, the operating system symbol turned green. For him, a light green shade (# A4C639) was chosen to create a contrast with other colors. Simultaneously with the robot icon, a blue wordmark was used: the stylized inscription “ANDROID.” Most letters lacked sidelines, with the first “A” looking lowercase. It was assumed that such a font would be the most technologically advanced and “computer.”</p>


            <h2>2014 – 2019</h2>
            <img src="Android-Logo-2014-2019-700x394.png" alt="Android Logo 2014-2019"> <br>

            <p>In 2014, the Android 5.0 Lollipop system was released with a new logo. The designers kept the classic image of the robot but repainted it in a darker shade. “Android” is now light green with all characters converted to lowercase. For the changed wordmark, the developers chose an understandable font – a round geometric sans serif. Users first saw this design option in Android 4.4.4 KitKat, but it received an official text logo status only in the Lollipop system.</p>

            <h2>2017 – 2019</h2>
            <img src="Android-Logo-2017-2019-700x394.png" alt="Android Logo 2017-2019"> <br>

            <p>Shortly before the global redesign, the operating system creators updated the inscription, making the letters bold. The new version graced the loading screen, advertisements, and the platform's website.</p>

            <h2>2019 – today</h2>
            <img src="Android-Logo-2019-present-700x394.jpg" alt="Android Logo 2019-present">

            <p>The current Android logo is the result of painstaking work by HUGE. Representatives of the creative agency completely revised the familiar brand to add modernity and accessibility to it. The basis of the identity is the green head of a robot in the form of a semicircle with eyes-circles and two antennas. Everything is as usual, but the color is now close to mint.</p>

            <p>For the lettering, the designers used a black and thinner font. This made it possible to make the title well readable against any background. The changes took effect with the release of a new version of the operating system – Android 10.</p>

            <h2>Font and Colours</h2>
            <img src="Android-Emblem-700x394.png" alt="Android Emblem">

            <p>The iconic platform icon was named Bugdroid because its upper part resembles a beetle. The Android team came up with this comic nickname themselves, and it is still used today, even though the robot's torso is missing on the emblem. The friendly mascot originally symbolized the curiosity and fun at the heart of open operating system standards.</p>

            <p>The Android logo font changed from complex to simply because the developers realized how important it is to make the lettering clear and understandable. Designers at HUGE have selected a sans-serif typeface suitable for display on any screen size. It is similar to Montreal Serial Medium, but the letters at the bottom have slight curves. At the same time, the inscription has become completely black, which is also designed to increase readability.</p>

            <p>After the redesign, Bugdroid received an updated green color (# 3DDC84). In addition, experts have come up with a whole palette of additional shades to improve contrast. Even the greenish-yellow, orange, and blue logos are considered official and allowed for use in different visual contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Android</strong>, operating system for cellular telephones and tablet computers. Android began in 2003 as a project of the American technology company <strong>Android Inc.</strong>, to develop an operating system for digital cameras. In 2004 the project changed to become an operating system for smartphones. Android Inc., was bought by the American search engine company <strong>Google Inc.</strong>, in 2005. At Google, the Android team decided to base their project on Linux, an open source operating system for personal computers.</p>
            
            <p>On November 5, 2007, Google announced the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of dozens of technology and mobile telephone companies, including Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Texas Instruments Incorporated, LG Electronics, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Sprint Nextel Corporation, and T-Mobile (Deutsche Telekom). The consortium was created in order to develop and promote Android as a free open source operating system with support for third-party applications. Android-based devices use wireless networks in order to take full advantage of features such as one-touch Google searches, Google Docs (e.g., word editors, spreadsheets), and Google Earth (satellite mapping software).</p>
            
            <p>The first cellular telephone to feature the new operating system was the T-Mobile G1, released on October 22, 2008. In 2012 Android became the most popular operating system for mobile devices, surpassing Apple's iOS, and, as of 2020, about 75 percent of mobile devices run Android.</p>

                <p>
                    The first public release of Android 1.0 occurred with the release of the T-Mobile G1 (aka HTC Dream) in October 2008. Android 1.0 and 1.1 were not released under specific code names. The code names "Astro Boy" and "Bender" were tagged internally on some of the early pre-1.0 milestone builds and were never used as the actual code names of the 1.0 and 1.1 releases of the OS.
                    The project manager, Ryan Gibson, conceived using a confectionery-themed naming scheme for public releases, starting with Android 1.5 Cupcake.

                    Google announced in August 2019 they were ending the confectionery theming scheme to use numerical ordering for future versions. The first release under the numerical order format was Android 10, which was released September 2019.
                    In 2017, Google announced that Google Play would begin to require apps to target a recent Android version. Since then, a new major Android version has been released in the second half of each year, and apps must target it by August 1 of the following year for new apps, or November 1 for app updates.
